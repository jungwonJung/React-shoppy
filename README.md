# Shoppy(Fake shoppingmall)

## [Shoppy](https://meek-figolla-e9ce50.netlify.app/) # Check this Service

I created a super simple online shopping mall to study React. It doesn't have many features, and I didn't develop any backend using Firebase. Instead, I focused on implementing basic functionalities that you would find in a real shopping mall. Through this project, I am learning React and exploring various features that are typically found in an actual e-commerce website
